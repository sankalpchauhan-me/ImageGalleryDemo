# WinForms Gallery Demo

- Used Event Driven Approach
- Tried my best to follow Coding Conventions
- Added controls dynamically
- Added components dynamically into the form
- Proper error handling for scenarios like No Internet, System Error, API Fails etc along with Displaying GUI Message to user for the same.
- Added Extra Controls
- Tried my best to seperate data, buisness logic and UI Components.

## Gif
- At the time of recording API was giving 403 Error {The Web App is Stopped}
- However that scenario was already handled in app, I will update here with new recording when api becomes functional again.
